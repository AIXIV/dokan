How to write a file system
==========================

To make a file system, an application needs to implement DokanOperations
interface. Once implemented, you can invoke DokanNet.DokanMain function
to mount a drive. The function blocks until the file system is unmounted.
Semantics and parameters are just like Dokan library. Details are described
at 'readme.txt' file in Dokan library. See sample codes under 'sample'
directory. Administrator privileges are required to run file system
applications.


Unmounting
==========

Just run the bellow command or your file system application call DokanNet.Unmount
to unmount a drive.

   > dokanctl.exe /u DriveLetter
